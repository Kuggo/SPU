# SPU
SPU (simple processing unit) is a CPU meant for teaching purposes. 

As the learning progresses more complex features will be added, and so this CPU and its ISA were split into 3 versions.
The different stages of the ISA can be found in google sheets [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JYFzMuOU_XgYev8DkWnMWqseIW-ITvi73hoEpkUki60/edit?usp=sharing). The V1 and V2 share the same exact isa. the V3 has essencially the same structure and features, but with the addition of CAL and RET instructions and a few other changes.

The ISA can be implemented in logic simulators, system verliog, breadboard or in any other way desired. I chose to build it in minecraft as im quite experienced in the game, and made a few cpus there.
The build in minecraft can be found on the server: ``mc.openredstone.org``

After that, type the command: ``/build`` and ``/p v Kuggo 2``
